How to use this documentation
=============================

This documentation is designed to help developers get started with
Enigma, describe our current software architecture, and clarify the
different parts of the Enigma system.

A practical “\ `getting started <#getting-started>`__\ ” section walks
through the development process of a secret contract. The “\ `system
design <#system-design>`__\ ” section describes the different components
of Enigma at a high level. Both “\ `software
architecture <#software-architecture>`__\ ” and “\ `subsystem
architecture <#subsystem-architecture>`__\ ” sections describe in detail
the current implementations of these components.

This is a living document, and we encourage discussion and debate on our
`developer forum <https://forum.enigma.co/>`__.

I want to **develop** my first secret contract...

   Get your feet wet with the `Getting Started
   Tutorial <#getting-started>`__\ **,** which will walk you through
   installing the docker image and writing your first secret contract.

   Jump right into the `EnigmaP.js client
   library <#enigma-js-client-library>`__

Learn about the `Enigma Contract <#enigma-contract>`__, which enables
secret contracts using Ethereum.

I’m looking for the **big picture** of developing on Enigma

The `System Design <#system-design>`__ section breaks down the layers of
developing on Enigma.

I am interested in the **protocol architecture...**

Check out our `Software Architecture Overview <#overview>`__ to see how
the pieces fit together

See the `network topography <#network-topology>`__ of this release

I want to know more about **encryption…**

Explore our **cryptography appendix**

How are you handling `key generation and
management <#client-encryption-and-storage>`__?

I want to know what **products** I can build with Enigma...
